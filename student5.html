            <h3>A Perpetual Positivity</h3>
          <br>
            <p>For Ameire, the glass is always half-full, never half-empty. But how does he do it? <br>Although easier said than done, he keeps his positive attitude by avoiding negative thoughts and focusing on the positive ones. By avoiding what could be holding him back, Ameire is able to look forward, toward the greater opportunities to come and to the excitement of the future. He also notes that simply the act of smiling itself allows him to elicit a feeling of happiness, keeping him strong through tougher times. <br>But that is not all; there is more to the equation: community and meditation. Surrounding himself with the right people is essential to his positivity and maintaining his attitude, Ameire says. Not only that but meditation helps him reflect back on his day and mistakes, so that he can learn from them. He is certain that “If you know what you have to change, it makes less room for mistakes.” Ameire gains both clarity and control through meditation; he becomes capable of manipulating his thoughts, attitude, and perspective on life. He is this year’s final highlight because of his optimism and his desire to succeed.

              <h3>A Team Everywhere</h3>
              <p>Ameire is a player on the Bayside Boys Football team, but he is not just any player- he was the team’s MVP during the 2024 season, leading the team with 12 touchdowns and 544 rushing yards. Beyond the numbers, Ameire’s attitude and work ethic are what separate him from other players and make him an integral part of the Bayside football team. Ameire’s junior varsity football coach Mr. Schwartz states, ”He's always talking to his teammates in a positive way and trying to pick guys up when they are down.” By bringing his infectious energy to every practice, every game, and every chant, Ameire inspires and uplifts his teammates in ways that are essential to the team’s success. <br>

            <div class = "pAndi" style = "width:100%;">
              <div id = "p">
                <p>According to Mr. Levitt, another one of the football coaches at Bayside, “In the game of football, teamwork is paramount for success and Ameire thrives in working as a team or group, and he will do so with a smile."  <br>

                  Apart from sports, Ameire was also a part of the school’s spring musical where he, once again, demonstrated his ability to work effectively in teams. A natural team player, he recalls enjoying the time he spent with the cast and all the moments spent fooling around and expressing themselves creatively. Mr. Morrison, the director of the spring musical, notes,”Ameire connects with his peers through genuine empathy and inclusiveness. His collaborative spirit and positive attitude foster teamwork and mutual respect, making everyone feel valued and motivated.”  <br>

                  Empathy is a trait often associated with Ameire and it is evident through his actions that he creates spaces built on the foundation of kindness, which, in turn, promotes harmony and teamwork. LB, a Bayside High School Dean, shares that Ameire cleans up the entire lunch table on behalf of the football team, which further attests to Ameire’s character, both in and out of others’ views. 
                     <br><br>
                  “He is that kid that you want on your team every year,” said Mr. Schwartz.

                <h3>A Limitless Growth</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Despite being only a sophomore, Ameire has grown remarkably throughout his time at Bayside. As a child, Ameire had played in sports before, such as basketball, and even trained in Muay Thai. As a matter of fact, it was his experience in Muay Thai and drive to become more agile which prompted him to join the football team. Unexpectedly, Ameire achieved much more than just agility: he was able to mature not only as an athlete, but as a person. Learning how to overcome adversity, fight as a team, and grow from mistakes are just a few of the lessons that Ameire has taken from his coaches and teammates. 
<br>
                Outside of life lessons, football has also been a fundamental part of the development of Ameire’s character, shaping him into the person he is today. In his reflection of the impact the sports community has had on him, Ameire claims, “If I didn’t join, I would just be a quiet person. I wouldn’t really be talking to people. But joining the football team helped me meet new people [and] find out new things…”
<br>
                Retrospectively, for Ameire, the football team “was a good place to grow up in.”
<br>
                However, the journey does not end for the incredibly driven sophomore. Active involvement in a school community does not come naturally nor does it come easily for many, but Ameire’s motivation is what allows him to keep pushing himself to new heights: “My biggest motivation is to be better.. I want to be better than how I was yesterday,” he explains.

                <h3>A Desire to Explore</h3>
                     <br>
                 <p>Beyond self improvement on a daily basis, Ameire also strives to explore new interests and enhance his knowledge on a variety of subjects. He takes full advantage of any opportunities which allow him to discover the unfamiliar, whether it be taking a variety of courses (such as AP Art History and Web Development) or traveling to unique places. Recalling his participation in the school’s trip to Spain this year, Ameire notes that he relished in the interactions he had with foreign cultures and hearing from his tour guide. Ms. Jasienowski, shares that it was a pleasure to have Ameire on the trip because he is the kind of person who takes the bull by the horn.

              <div id = "p">
                
                 <p> <br>His ceaseless curiosity is also what led Ameire to join, then re-audition for the school play because it allowed him to “step out of [his] comfort zone and act; be somebody new.” In fact, his performance, as Mr. Morrison notes, “had a profound impact on the audience”, even as to “inspiring the student body, creating a sense of pride and excitement."<br>For the incoming freshman, Ameire leaves this message: “Be open and try new things. Don’t follow what everybody else is doing. Just be your own person.”
